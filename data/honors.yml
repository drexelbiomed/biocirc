- "Dr. Throckmorton and Dr. Randy Stevens received a newly approved USPTO patent: “Integrated Cutting Guide with Cardioprotective Butterfly for Repeat Sternotomy and for Cast Cutting (#11202645).” Thousands of babies are born each year with severe malformations of their heart chambers and surrounding vasculature. We invented a multi-layered patch-like structure that protects the baby's heart from being nicked during required re-sternotomy procedures. The cardioprotective butterfly guides the surgical saw during re-sternotomies, provides a synthetic protective lining between the saw and baby's heart, and incorporates drain ports for clinical assessment and management during healing."
