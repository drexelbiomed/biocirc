  %p Thousands of children are born each year with complex congenital heart defects. A subset of those patients has only one functional ventricle, require corrective cardiac surgeries, and endure long-term clinical treatment. These single ventricle patients experience a steady decline in cardiovascular function to premature congestive heart failure, and limited therapeutic options exist for them. To address this unmet need, the BioCirc Research Laboratory in the Drexel School of Biomedical Engineering is developing an intravascular axial flow blood pump for placement directly into blood vessel...
